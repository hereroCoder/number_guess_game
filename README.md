# Computer Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Computer Number Guessing Game! This Python-based game offers two exciting modes: one where the computer tries to guess your secret number and another where you guess the computer's chosen number.

## Game Modes

### Mode 1: Computer Guesses Your Number

In this mode, you think of a number, and the computer tries to guess it. The game proceeds as follows:

- You think of a number between 1 and 100.
- The computer makes its guess.
- You respond with "yes" or "no."
- If the computer's guess is incorrect, you provide a hint to go higher or lower.
- The computer uses your hints to adjust its next guess and continues until it guesses correctly or reaches a maximum of 10 attempts.

Can you keep the computer guessing?

### Mode 2: User Guesses Computer's Number

In this mode, the computer selects a random number, and you have to guess it. Here's how it works:

- The computer chooses a random number.
- You get 10 chances to guess the number.
- After each guess, the computer will provide hints to help you narrow down your guess.
- The computer will tell you if your guess should be higher or lower.

Can you outsmart the computer and guess the correct number in time?

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game by executing `python number_guess.py`.

## Game Trials

You have three chances to play the game in different modes. Choose the mode that suits your preference. The modes are:

1. Computer guesses your number.
2. User guesses the computer's number.

## Gameplay Instructions

- In the first mode, you think of a secret number, and the computer will try to guess it with your hints.
- In the second mode, guess the computer's selected number and use hints to refine your guesses.

## Winning and Losing

- If the computer correctly guesses your number in Mode 1, you lose. It will show you how many attempts it took.
- If the computer fails to guess your number, you win.
- If you correctly guess the number in Mode 2, you win! The computer will reveal the number and let you know how quickly you solved the puzzle.
- If you don't guess the number in time, you lose.
